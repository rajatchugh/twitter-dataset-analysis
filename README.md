# twitter-dataset-analysis
I decided to choose both “Ticketmaster” and “Taylor Swift” as our keywords due to the recent
sale of her concert tickets in the US at the time of the project(Dec'22). We were interested in analyzing this trend, due to the high
demand that the tickets generated. We ended up using only “Ticketmaster” data given the
higher amount of tweets in this set. 

## The analysis will help you understand and visualize the various aspects of the twitter data. This can become a baseline for any kind of dataset
